Once they are offered a full time placement offer by a particular company, they \nhave to accept it, and they will be out of the placement process.  \n \nEligibility for Placements and Internships:  \n1.     Students who have successfully qualified for an internship are \neligible for only placem ents.  \n2.     Students who have successfully qualified for a placement are \neligible only for internships.  \n3.     Students who have secured both a placement and an internship \n(I+P) are exempted from the placement process.  \n4.     Candidates should clearly communicate to the HR before their \ninterviews, if they are interested in either placements, internships, or if \nthey have secured both opportunities.  \nPlease note that categorisation  of companies and betterment is available \nonly for BTech students and not for MTech and MCA  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nRules for BTech  \nBased on our experience last year, the tier system has been updated to categorize \ncompanies into 3 types, based on their CTC as given bel ow: \n \nCategory  Branch  CTC Range (INR)  \nNormal  CE & IT  \n \nCircuit Branches  \n \nAll Other Branches  <18 LPA  \n \n<14 LPA  \n \n<11 LPA  \nDream  CE & IT  \n \nCircuit Branches  \n \nAll Other Branches  \u226518 LPA & <40 LPA  \n \n\u226514 LPA & <40 LPA  \n \n\u226511 LPA & <40 LPA  \nSuper Dream  All Branches  \u226540 LPA \n \nOnce a student has been placed in a company falling into a particular \ncategory, moving forward, they will be permitted to apply for only those \ncompanies which fall into a higher category than the one they are \ncurrently placed in. However the betterment, i. e getting placed in a \ncompany of a higher category, is restricted to  only one time.  \nNote: \u201cPlacement\u201d can be either through PPO or Direct Full Time Offer. \nFor Example:  \n\u25cf      A student gets placement in company PQR [Normal].  \n\u25cf      Now, they can still appl y to Dream and Super -Dream companies. (Rule: \nApplication to better category is allowed)  \n \n \u25cf      If they get selected in company LMN [Dream], then they are out of the \nplacement process, and cannot apply to any other company, even of the \nSuper -Dream category.  (Rule: Switch to any other better category is \nrestricted to one time only)  \n\u25cf      They will be finally placed in LMN [Dream].  \n \nThe Betterment Gap Rule:  \nStudents are not permitted to apply to companies whose offered CTC falls \nwithin a range given below of their existing offer.  \nBranch  Minimum Betterment Gap  \nCE, IT & circuit Branches  3 LPA (CTC)  \nAll other branches  2 LPA (CTC)  \n \nFor Example:  \n\u25cf      A student gets an offer in company PQR [CTC: 15 LPA ].  \n\u25cf    They can only apply for company  LMN [CTC: \u2265 18 LPA].  \n\u25cf    This will be considered as a betterment switch.  \n \nIf a student is waitlisted (or there is a delay in result declaration) by company ABC and later \nthey get a job in some other company PQR, and then if the company ABC gives an offer  \nthen the student will have a choice to decide between ABC and PQR. But, that will be \ncounted as a betterment switch and then the student cannot apply for betterment after that.  \n  \nPlease note that students interning at a particular company are not permitte d to apply \nfor the same company through the placement process.  \n  \n  \n \n Note:  Circuit  branches  include  Electronics  and          \n Telecommunication Engineering, Electronics Engineering and \nElectrical Engineering.  \nPre-placement Offers (PPO)  \nCommon rules for BTech, MTech and MCA  \n1. Companies are requested to release their PPO by the end of August, as \nthe Final Placement process starts from 1st August each year. (TPO will \nremind the companies, and the students are also requested to do the \nneedful from their end, and remind their respective companies).  \n2. If a student wishes to reject a potential PPO, they should discuss and \ninform their company accordingly before the final PPO details are \ndeclared by the company to the TPO.  \n3. Once a student is offered a  PPO, it is considered that they have been \nplaced in that  company.  \n4.  A PPO offered by a company can be rejected by the student if it has a \nCTC of less than 11 LPA.   \n  \nRules for B.Tech. only  \n1.  If the student gets a PPO, they can avail only one more placement offer \nof a company in a higher tier.  \n2.  If the student receives a placement offer in the same category as their \ninternship company\u2019s PPO, and the internship company releases the \nPPO subsequently, the student will be ineligible to accept the PPO. The \nTPO will promptly notify the internship company to refrain from issuing a \nPPO.  \n3.  If the student wishes to be eligible for a maximum of 2 offers through the \nplacement process, they should inform the company not to consider \nthem for PPO before it is  released.  \n \n 4.  If a student wishes to pursue postgraduate studies, or is unsure, they \nwill be allowed to accept a PPO if offered by a company.  \n \n \nOff-Campus Offers  \n1.     Before the beginning of the placement season, a record will be \ncreated in order to unders tand the students preferences whether they \nwant to participate in the placement process, pursue postgraduate \nstudies, or completely opt out of the placement process. Only those who \nwish to participate in the placement process will be eligible to apply for \non-campus placements. Students opting for higher studies  can apply in \ncompanies offering \u2264 12 LPA for CE,IT & Circuital branches; \u2264 10 LPA for \nall other branches.  \n2.     During the on -campus placement drive, if a student who had initially \nindicated their preference to participate in the placement process and has \nnot yet received a final offer from a company, wishes to quit the on -\ncampus placement drive and opt for postgraduate studies / off -campus \nopportunities can do so. They need to inform their concerne d TPO CR in \norder to update their preferences.  \n3.     During the on -campus placement drive, if a student who had initially \nindicated their preference to pursue postgraduate studies or completely \nopt out of the placement process, wishes to take part in the on-campus \nplacement drive can do so. They need to inform their concerned TPO CR \nin order to update their preferences before applying for on -campus \nopportunities . \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nInternships  \n1.     All internships will follow the \u201cOnce student, One  internship offer\u201d \npolicy.  \n2.     Once a student is offered an internship through the TPO, they will \nbe out of the internship process, and will no longer be eligible for any \nother company\u2019s process.  \n3.     The student must join the company for their internship. If they reject \nthe internship offer or do not join the company, then they will be \nblacklisted and not be allowed to appear for the placement drive the \nfollowing year.  \n  \nRegarding Internships for BTech, MTech and MCA  \nIf a student rejects an inte rnship offer or does not join the company, instead opting for an \noff-campus offer, then they will be blacklisted and not be allowed to appear for the \nplacement drive the following year.  \n  \nRegarding Placements for BTech, MTech and MCA  \nStudents placed via th e on-campus placement drive will have to compulsorily join the \ncompany for at least 1 year. Strict action (including blocking of transcript) will be taken \nagainst students who violate this rule.  \n \n \n Academics and TPO  \n1.  The TPO has no say in academic and examination -related matters.  \n2.     The institute\u2019s academic section does not allow students to do \ninternships (and any other work) that overlap with academic activities. \nTPO will hence not allow companies to offer internships and full time \noffers having their dates overlapping with the dates when academic \nactivities are held (according to the official academic calendar released \nby the institute).  \nInstructions to Company Officials  \n1.     The Training and Placement Office allots a date to the company as \nper the ranking on the basis of following parameters: Job profile and \ngrowth prospects, the package (CTC) being offered by the company, \npast record of recruitment at VJTI, feedback from the students \nregarding the company.  \n2.  Companies are requested to declar e the result of placement \nimmediately after interviews (on the same day before 11:59 PM). \nHowever, if another company visits before the declaration of results, \nstudents will be allowed to sit for the other company.  \n3.  If a student gets an offer from any c ompany, they need to \nimmediately accept it, by the end of day. (If a student gets an offer from \nmore than one company on the same day, they can accept an offer \nfrom any one company of their choice - will not be counted as \nbetterment).  \n4.     Any correspond ence with the students regarding offer letters or \nany other matter should be done only through the TPO.  \n5.     HRs/hiring managers should clearly mention the job profile \nand CTC (final amount, along with break -up) in the Job \nApplication Form (JAF).  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThank you and all the best for Placements  \n======================================================================="}]}
